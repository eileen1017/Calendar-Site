Creative protion:
1. In our creative portion, users can share their calendar with additional users. In this case, we create anouther table shares which includes the name and id share_to_user, and the name and id of the send user. When the calendar is shared, the information is stored in the table first. And then whenever the shar_to_user wants to get access to the shared calendar, they can look into the table first and get information about the sender.    
2. In our creative portion, users can tag an event with a particular category and enable/disable those tags in the calendar view. We set the 7 catagories, including study, work, fun, date,travel, family and other.


Note: In our project,there shows some error in validation. However, I have checked that it is due to bootstrap online css and js source problem. Other than that, the validation shows no errors.
